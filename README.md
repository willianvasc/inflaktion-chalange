<p>Hi everyone! For this project, I used the <b>Plates</b> library to render the views and the <b>Router</b> to manage the routes. I hope you enjoy it!</p>
<span>To run the project, you need to execute the command <b>composer update</b>. After that, run <b>php -S localhost:8000 -t public</b>.</span>
<span>It's necessary to create a database called <b>"successful_emails"</b> and a table named <b>"successful_emails"</b> with the fields <b>id</b>, <b>email</b>, and <b>raw_text</b>.</span>
